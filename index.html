                    <p>I'm a full-stack software engineer from Sydney currently living in Seattle and working at Palantir. I currently work on a frontend infrastructure team, building tooling to improve the experience of other frontend developers.</p>

                    <p>You can find a history of my personal projects on <a href="https://github.com/johnwiseheart">GitHub</a>.</p>

                    <p>Two of my favourite hobbies are baking and cooking. I keep a list of the recipes that I have baked and would like to bake, with any notes and additions on <a href="https://recipes.johnwiseheart.me/">Notion</a>.</p>
